Since stack-protection is turned on, there're two main ways to bypass it as we discussed in class. 
First, we can possibly let the server print out a pointer in error messages, which will contain the offset from canaries to base address. 
Second, we can use heap overflow to bypass the canary. We have a struct contains a string and a function pointer. Since it's
on heap, we can thus ignore canaries. Just overflow the string and have the address we want at the function pointer. Then, it can bypass the canaries and complete an attack.
